# Grillageddon

This game was created to learn the Rust programming language. I had ideas for this game that included a rough story more guns and enemies. Upgrades that would randomly spawn around the map. But I lost interest in "Finishing" this game. 
I realised that I am more a fan of gameplay and systems programming, having to create art and music as a solo dev really burned me out when working on this project ( this was probably not helped by this being my first "real" project in Rust )

## What was used
* Rust
* Macroquad
* Aseprite

## What did I learn
* I learnt a great deal about the Rust programming language and will be using it in future projects
* I learnt about ways to approach game development in a non-oop way ( i felt like this was an eye opener ) I will be going down a rabbit hole of learning about Data Oriented Design for my next game projects.

## What was planned
* more enemy variants
* more guns
* upgrades the player could pick up
