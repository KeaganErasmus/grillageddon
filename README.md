# Grillageddon

This "game" was created to learn the Rust programming language. This game has a very simple game loop, the aim I guess is to get the highest score.

## What was used
* Rust
* Macroquad
* Aseprite

## What did I learn
* I learnt a great deal about the Rust programming language and will likely be using it in future projects
* I learnt about ways to approach game development in a non-oop way.
* I learnt a lot about implementing game systems
